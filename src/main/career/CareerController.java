/**
 * The CareerController class provides methods to manage careers, including creating, updating, viewing,
 * and deleting career instances. It also allows searching and viewing subjects related to a specific career.
 * Implements the Controller interface to provide consistent control flow and rendering methods.
 *
 * <p>Methods:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>getInstance() - Retrieves the singleton instance of the CareerController.</li>
 *   <li>index() - Renders the index view for careers.</li>
 *   <li>create(boolean save, Career model) - Creates a new career instance and optionally saves it.</li>
 *   <li>update(boolean save, int id) - Updates an existing career instance by its ID and optionally saves it.</li>
 *   <li>view(int id) - Views a career instance by its ID.</li>
 *   <li>delete(boolean validation, int id) - Deletes a career instance by its ID with optional validation.</li>
 *   <li>search(boolean viewSubjects) - Renders the search view for careers with an option to view subjects.</li>
 *   <li>viewSubjects(int idCareer) - Views the subjects related to a specific career by its ID.</li>
 * </ul>
